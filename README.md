# greenmotion-frontend

TO DO:
- Data processing/cleaning should be done in the backend
- UI should be improved, using left hand menu instead of tabs
- Each feature should be separated into a different module
- Custom Date Range and Search by Date should be almost identical in terms of code
- Should be easy to implement a new location in the backend
- Create a way for multiple people to run the custom date range search at the same time, view a "status" page for all searches
- Create a tab explaining when the schedule workflows will run
- Create API layer for interacting with the backend
- Add mypy and pylint and imports sorting
- Add unit and integration tests
- Move events to an events repository
- Build github actions modules that are reusable (inside a separate repository?)
- Use Apache Iceberg to build a data warehouse for storing all data from S3 (for rtg automotive)
- Build an API to interact with the data warehouse using FastAPI, lambda, api gateway and pydantic
- Create backend project template
- Create frontend project template
