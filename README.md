TECH DEBT:

- Data processing/cleaning should be done in the backend
- UI should be improved, using left hand menu instead of tabs
- Each feature should be separated into a different module
- Custom Date Range and Search by Date should be almost identical in terms of code
- Should be easy to implement a new location in the backend
- Create a way for multiple people to run the custom date range search at the same time, view a "status" page for all searches
- Create a tab explaining when the schedule workflows will run
- Add mypy and pylint
- Add unit and integration tests
